# Health-Insurance-Cost-prediction
Developed a machine learning model to predict health insurance costs, aiding in pricing strategy and risk assessment.
Developed a health insurance cost prediction model using data analysis and machine learning in Python. Achieved efficient feature engineering and model training to improve pricing accuracy.
Compared and visualized model performance for informed decision-making.
Evaluated the machine learning algorithms to select the best-performing model.
Utilized Joblib to save the trained model for future use.
Designed a graphical user interface (GUI) for easy interaction with the predictive model.
